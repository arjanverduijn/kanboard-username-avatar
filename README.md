Documentation
-------------

Many people cannot be bothered or don't want to provide a user avatar like a photograph or
a Gravatar icon. For those people this Kanboard plugin provides an avatar that is
guaranteed to be unique because it uses that username instead of just the initials. Already in
an intermediate-size organization the likelihood of two users having the same initials is quite
close to unity. Externally provided avatars can still be used.

Because the full username is displayed and this uniquely identifies the user the full name is
suppressed. This allows more compact viewing of tasks.
