Documentation
-------------

Many people cannot be bothered or don't want to provide a user avatar like a photograph or
a Gravatar icon. For those people this Kanboard plugin provides an avatar that is
guaranteed to be unique because it is based on the full username instead of just the
initials. Already in an intermediate-size organization the likelihood of two users having
the same initials is quite close to unity. Externally provided avatars can still be used.

Because the full username is displayed and this uniquely identifies the user the full name is
suppressed. This allows more compact viewing of tasks.

In addition, an avatar is show on the task cards in compact board view.
